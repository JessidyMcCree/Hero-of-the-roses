This is the idea for a future rogue-like, platform game
 Our protagonist Rosalia belongs to a wealthy family, but that family is fighting with the tulip clan. But she is in love with Tulio, who belongs to the same clan. They both want this war to end, so she and her lover go together in search of the legendary Ether flower. But they also need to defeat the heads of the violet clan, jasmine and so on.
